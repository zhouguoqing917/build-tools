## Fixtures testing

here are some fixtures for manual testing things we don't have Jest tests for.

- `build-default` focuses on our zero config defaults
- `build-invalid` lets us check what happens when we have invalid builds due to type errors
- `build-withConfig` lets us check that `tsdx.config.js` works as expected
- `build-withTsconfig` lets us check that `tsconfig.json` options are correctly used
